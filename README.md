# Caterpillar Crawl
Android game
# Game Description
This is a simple Android game, similar to the game Snake. A caterpillar moves across the screen, and depending on which side of the screen the user taps on the caterpillar will turn. Eat apples to gain segments, running into a wall or into another segment will result in a game over!
# Scoring
Scoring is based on how many segments long your caterpillar is. A game over will result in returning to the home screen and getting your score and the high score.
